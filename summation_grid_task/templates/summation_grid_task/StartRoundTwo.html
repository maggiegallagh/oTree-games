    <p> <strong> Instructions: </strong></p>

    <p>Welcome! For this job, you will be asked to solve as many Summing Digits problems as possible.  In each problem, you will be presented with a 3x3 grid, with each cell containing a number with two decimal places.  You must identify the two numbers in the grid that add up to 10.0 exactly.  For example, if you are presented with a grid that includes the numbers 9.7 and 0.3, you would input 9.7 and 0.3 since the two numbers add up exactly to 10.0.</p>

    <p>There will be two rounds, each lasting 2 minutes. In each round, you will receive [$0.10] for each correct answer. After completing two rounds of the task, you will receive an overview of the number of correct answers and your total payoff. </p>

    <br/><p> These instructions will be repeated on every page for your convenience.  Press the button when you are ready to begin. </p>
