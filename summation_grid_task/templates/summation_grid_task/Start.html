    <p> <strong> Instructions: </strong></p>

    <p>Welcome! For this job, you will be asked to solve as many Summing Digits problems as possible.  In each problem, you will be presented with a 3x3 grid, with each cell containing a number with one decimal place.  You must identify the two numbers in the grid that add up to 10.0 exactly. Be sure to type the numbers exactly as you see them in the grid.  For example, if you are presented with a grid that includes the numbers 9.7 and 0.3, you would input 9.7 and 0.3 since the two numbers add up exactly to 10.0.  You must type 0.3 and not .3</p>
    <p>There will be two rounds, each lasting 2 minutes. In each round, you will receive $0.10 for each correct answer. After completing two rounds of the task, you will receive an overview of the number of correct answers, your total payoff, and a completion code. </p>
