      Welcome! For this job, you will be asked to solve as many Stroop problems as possible.
      In each problem, you will be presented with color words, such as blue, red, or green.
      The task is to name the color of the font the words are printed in, while ignoring the actual meaning of the word.
      For example, if you see the word BLUE written in red ink, as the example below, you should select the answer for red.</p>
    <p><center><strong><font color = red> BLUE </font></strong></center></p>

    <p>There will be two rounds, each lasting 30 seconds.
      In each round, you will receive $0.10 for each correct answer.
      After completing two rounds of the task, you will receive an overview of the number of correct answers and your total payoff for the Stroop game.  You will be asked to complete a questionnaire.</p>

    <p>You will then be asked to solve as many Summing Digits problems as possible.
    In each problem, you will be presented with a 3x3 grid, with each cell containing a number with two decimal places.
    You must identify the two numbers in the grid that add up to 10.0 exactly.
    For example, if you are presented with a grid that includes the numbers 9.7
      and 0.3, you would input 9.7 and 0.3 since the two numbers add up exactly to 10.0.
    There will be two rounds, each lasting 2 minutes.
      Again, in each round, you will receive $0.10 for each correct answer. </p>

    <p>After completing two rounds of the task, you will receive an overview of the number of correct answers, your total payoff for the Summing Digits Game, and a completion code.
      After completing this HIT, you will receive your reward for both games.
