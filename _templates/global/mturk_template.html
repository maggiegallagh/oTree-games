            Welcome! For this job, you will be asked to solve as many Stroop problems as possible. In each problem, you
            will be presented with color words, such as blue, red, or green. The task is to name the color of the font
            the words are printed in, while ignoring the actual meaning of the word. For example, if you see the word
            BLUE written in black ink, as the example below, you should select the answer for black.</p>
        <p>
        <center>BLUE</center>
        </p>

        <p>There will be two rounds, each lasting 30 seconds. In each round, you will receive [$0.10] for each correct
            answer.
            After completing two rounds of the task, you will be asked to complete a questionnaire, and receive an
            overview of the number of correct answers and your total payoff.

        <p>You will then be asked to solve as many Summing Digits problems as possible.
            In each problem, you will be presented with a 3x3 grid, with each cell containing a number with two decimal
            places.
            You must identify the two numbers in the grid that add up to 10.0 exactly.
            For example, if you are presented with a grid that includes the numbers 9.7 and 0.3, you would input 9.7 and
            0.3 since the two numbers add up exactly to 10.0.
            There will be two rounds, each lasting 2 minutes. Again, in each round, you will receive [$0.10] for each
            correct answer. </p>


        <p>After completing two rounds of the task, you will be asked to complete a questionnaire, and receive an
            overview of the number of correct answers and your total payoff.
            After completing this HIT, you will receive your reward.
        </p>        </p>
